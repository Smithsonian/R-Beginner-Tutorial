Beginner Information for learning R

Folder contails an R script (IntroR.R, an html file (IntroR.html) for viewing in a browser, and an R-Markdown (.Rmd). An export_to_R.R file is located in the ancillary_files directory.  This files is used simply to create the R script from the R-Markdown file. It is placed here for reference.

To view the files and work with them directly, use the Download.zip file and save to your computer.  The IntroR.html file can then be used to follow the lecture and the IntroR.R file has the commands to work interactively.  

I recommend using R-Studio for this exercise and setting the working directory to the location where you saved all the files.
