Folder contails an R script (IntroR.R, an html file (IntroR.html) for viewing in a browser, and an R-Markdown (.Rmd).

To view the files and work with them directly, use the Download ZIP file under "Clone or download" and save to your computer.  The IntroR.html file can then be used to follow the lecture and the IntroR.R file has the commands to work interactively.  

I recommend using R-Studio for this exercise and setting the working directory to the location where you saved all the files.
